## Objectives

We are an indie game development team formed by 7 students taking the bachelor's degree in Game design and development in the UPC.
The game will be developed for the subject Project II. We will be making a tribute to the well-known RTS game: Command&Conquer: Red Alert 2.

## Game info

The game we're developing is a mix between the classic RTS games and the tower defense genre.
It has one very clear objective for both players: "Crush your opposition without showing any mercy!"

Command and Conquer: WarZone, features a streamlined resource system that allows the player to focus on more important tasks such as fighting and defending your precious base.
We have also implemented an automatic troop AI, this means that once deployed, they will go to their main objective. It can be everything, defensive structures or the Town Hall itself.

The game is intended to be player with controllers for 2 people at a time.
