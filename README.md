## Game info

The game we're developing is a mix between the classic RTS games and the tower defense genre.
It has one very clear objective for both players: "Crush your opposition without showing any mercy!"

Command and Conquer: WarZone, features a streamlined resource system that allows the player to focus on more important tasks such as fighting and defending your precious base.
We have also implemented an automatic troop AI, as well as an auto-deploy from the barracks they have been created. 
This means that once bought, they will automatically be deployed and they will go to their main objective. 
It can be everything, enemy troops, defensive structures or the Town Hall itself.

The game also features a polished UI so any new players can quickly grasp how to navigate through the UI and allows seasoned players to execute more efficiently.
The game also communicates with the players to notify them about the game state via voicelines.

The game is intended to be player with controllers for 2 people at a time.

We are an indie game development team formed by 7 students taking the bachelor's degree in Videogame design and development in the UPC.
The game will be developed for the subject Project II. We will be making a tribute to the well-known RTS game: Command&Conquer: Red Alert 2.

## How to play

As stated in the game info, each player will have one controller where they can control the UI from his faction.
The controls of the controllers as well as debugging functions with keyboard/mouse can be found in the next section below.

- Allies(Player1): Blue. Base located in the left side of the screen. UI located on the bottom-right corner

- Soviets(Player2): Red. Base located in the left side of the screen. UI located on the top-left corner

The main objective of the game is **to destroy the opponents' TownHall.**

In order to achieve this, the player must manage resources via gold mines, create troops via barracks and use the defensive buildings(AoE and single-target) 
to defend all the other buildings. And more importantly, the main base which can't be built once destroyed nor repaired under any circumstance.

Every button or window in the main UI has a decription about what it does and the stats for the troop/building to be build or deployed.

### Buildings and troops
